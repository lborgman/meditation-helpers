        It should work similar to the app described in this

        <p>
          If you want to do as in the study you should use this app several times each day,
          for a total of at least 10&nbsp;minutes.
          This app will keep track of how much time you have used the app each day.

          Each time you use the app you meditate for as long as the app tells you.
          After that you tell the app if you managed to keep your attention on the breath.

        <p>
          That is all. It is as simple as that.

              Be aware if, at any point, your attention has fully wandered away from the breath. Without any judgement,

              <h3>
                Initial Meditation Instructions
              </h3>
              <p>
                For the next six weeks you will be using this app to practice mindfulness awareness of your breathing,
                which is
                a training in mindfulness attention.

                <mark>
                  During this training period, you will practice focusing your
                  attention on the
                  natural rhythms of the breath, using the breath as a way to develop attention and calm your
                  concentration.
                  This
                  is not a breath control practice, but a practice of awareness.</mark>

                Now I‚Äôll give you some suggestions for
                how
                to start
                in your journey of learning to mindfully attend to your breath.
                The first step is to settle into your body. Find a way to sit that is both comfortable, relaxed, yet
                also
                alert and
                present. As you find a stable posture and feel settled, try to let go and relax into the position. Now,
                pay attention
                to your body; scan your body and let go of any obvious tensions that you can easily release. Let the
                eyes
                and
                face be soft, loosen the jaw, let the shoulders relax and rest your arms and hand rest comfortably. Now
                let your
                belly be soft and your breath natural.
                Now the next step is to notice your body breathing; feel how the body breathes on its own in a natural
                rhythm,
                sometimes fast or slow, sometimes deep or shallow. Now simply bring your attention to wherever you can
                most
                easily sense this breathing rhythm. It might be coolness in your nostrils, or the swirling tingling in
                the
                back of
                the throat, or the brush of the air against your upper lip. It might be the rise and fall of chest or
                belly. It might
                even be your whole body breathing. If it's difficult to feel the rhythm of your breath, then take one
                hand
                and
                place it on your belly and feel the rise and fall of your belly in the palm of your hand, and rest it
                there as your
                place of awareness.
                Now that you‚Äôve settled in you body and begun to sense your breath, notice it's natural rhythms and
                variations.
                Some breaths might be shorter or longer than others. Let your body breathe as it wishes. As you feel
                each
                breath
                with your attention, try to invite a calm and steadiness of body and mind so that each breath, breathing
                in and
                breathing out, brings a sense of calm and peace. Let other experiences that arise, such as sounds,
                thoughts,
                feelings, and body sensations come and go, rise and fall like waves of the ocean around the breath. Keep
                your
                attention resting on the natural rhythm of the breath.

                <mark>
                  Be aware if, at any point, your attention has
                  fully
                  wandered away from the breath. Without any judgement, gently bring it back to the next breath.</mark>

                It is
                like
                training a puppy; bring it back gently, sit, and stay. By gradually returning again and again to the
                breath, you will
                learn to be aware of the breath and to focus your attention gradually, more deeply. Like with any
                training--like
                learning piano or practicing basketball, you are learning the art of steadying your attention. Steadying
                and
                focusing your attention is a skill that will serve you in every area of your life.
              </p>

              <h3>
                Meditation Instructions 2 (Given prior to starting the third week of training)
              </h3>
              <p>
                To further help your focus on attention on the breath, for this next period, along with noticing the
                breath as you
                have, include awareness if there are spaces between the breath. In these gaps, keep your attention in
                the
                same
                area of your body until the next breath begins. This helps the attention become more continuous and
                steady.
              </p>

              <h3>
                Meditation Instructions 3 (Given prior to starting the fifth week of training)
              </h3>
              <p>
                To again further help your focus of attention on the breath, for this next period, along with noticing
                the
                breath,
                include awareness of any moments of calm and well-being that arise as your sense the breath. Continue
                your
                awareness of the breath, and at the same time, feel how the calm steady wellbeing can increase along
                with
                your
                growing attention.

        <p>
          I wrote this small app when I read about the study I mention.
          It looks like a good idea making a tool like this widely and free available.

          This is a "web app" (actually a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_applications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PWA</a>
          ).
          You can say it runs in your web browser so you can use it anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          You don't have to install anything, but you can install a PWA.
          Then you can use it offline.
          And you get an icon on your mobile where it will look like any app.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will need a modern web browser for this to work.
          Google Chrome and Firefox are ok.
